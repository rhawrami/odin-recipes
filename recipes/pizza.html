        <h1>The Real Chicago Deep Dish Pizza</h1>
        <p>It may seem difficult to make a Chicago deep dish, but with our
            recipe, it'll be easy as cake, or rather pizza (yes we like to
            joke around here).
        </p>
        <p>Here's what the final product will look like:</p>

        <h2>The Recipe</h2>
        <p>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until 
            yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes. 
            Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough 
            holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</p>
        <p>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and 
            let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours. Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press 
            dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan and follow your pizza recipe.</p>
